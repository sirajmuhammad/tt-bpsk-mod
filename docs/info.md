## How it works

A transmit-only BPSK baseband modulator. The datapath is:

`PRBS-7 -> +/-1 BPSK mapper -> polyphase RRC pulse shaper -> 8-bit signed sample bus`

- **PRBS-7 generator** — `x^7 + x^6 + 1`, seed `7'h7F`, giving a 127-bit period that is
  short enough to verify by eye in a waveform. `prbs_reload` (`ui[3]`) reseeds it.
- **BPSK mapper** — maps each data bit to a `+/-1` symbol. `data_sel` (`ui[1]`) chooses
  between the internal PRBS and an external bit on `ext_data` (`ui[2]`).
- **RRC pulse shaper** — root-raised-cosine, rolloff 0.35, 4 symbol span, 17 taps,
  8-bit signed coefficients, at 4 samples per symbol.

  The shaper is implemented as a **polyphase** filter rather than a literal 17-tap FIR.
  Because the mapper emits impulses at 4x with zeros between them, only about 5 taps see
  a nonzero input at any output phase. The design therefore keeps a 5-deep shift register
  of symbol signs and selects one of 4 coefficient sets by phase, so each output sample is
  a 5-term add/subtract. Since BPSK symbols are `+/-1`, every tap is a sign-selected add
  and **no multipliers are needed**.

  The coefficients are scaled so that the worst case — all five signs aligned — sums to
  `<= 127`. Overflow is therefore impossible by construction and **there is no saturation
  logic**, which removes the most likely source of disagreement between the RTL and the
  reference model.

Output is 8-bit signed two's complement on `uo[7:0]`, with `sample_valid` (`uio[0]`)
pulsing one clock per sample and `symbol_tick` (`uio[1]`) one clock per symbol. The raw
PRBS bit is echoed on `uio[2]` so a host can align for BER measurement. `clk_div_sel`
(`ui[7:4]`) divides the input clock to set the symbol rate.

The chip does baseband only. Demodulation, RF upconversion, and BER counting all live
off-chip.

**Status:** the RTL in `src/project.v` is currently the unmodified Tiny Tapeout template
passthrough. This datasheet describes the target design; the pin map above is the
intended final mapping.

## How to test

Drive `clk` and release `rst_n`, then set `tx_enable` (`ui[0]`) high with `data_sel`
(`ui[1]`) low to select the internal PRBS-7 source. Shaped samples appear on `uo[7:0]`,
one per `sample_valid` (`uio[0]`) pulse, as 8-bit signed two's complement values.

Capture the sample bus on each `sample_valid` and compare against the Python/numpy
reference model, which generates the RRC taps, the PRBS-7 sequence, and the expected
shaped output. Verification is a bit-exact match against that model, run under cocotb
(`cd test && make`) at both RTL and gate level.

To drive external data instead of the PRBS, set `data_sel` (`ui[1]`) high and present the
bit stream on `ext_data` (`ui[2]`), advancing one bit per `symbol_tick` (`uio[1]`).
Pulsing `prbs_reload` (`ui[3]`) reseeds the generator to `7'h7F` so a capture can be
aligned to a known starting state.

## External hardware

None required to exercise the design — it can be clocked and read directly from the
demo board.

For the full transmit chain:

- **RP2040 demo board** — PIO burst capture of the parallel sample bus, dumped over
  USB-CDC as a `.bin` file.
- **GNU Radio** on the host — File Source -> Char To Float -> Multiply Const ->
  Float To Complex, feeding a bladeRF sink.
- **bladeRF** — RF upconversion. All demodulation (matched filter, timing recovery,
  slicer, BER counting) is done in GNU Radio on the host.
